Task: 
Objective

Design a mobile-based receipts page or pages for customers to view receipts for purchases made at an online retail store like Amazon.com. The customer should be able to view receipts by week, month and year. The customer should be able to apply date filters and search for a receipt based on the product name. The results should always be sorted by date (most recent first).

 

Assume that tax is 9.25% of the sub total price (sum of the total price of all the items purchased).

Feel free to add anything else that you think will make a great receipts page or pages.


Documentation:

Technologies Used: HTML, javaScript, React.js, Node.js, Mysql, express, material UI components.

This project is mainly a skeleton of my intentions with completing the above task. The data is fetched from my local database. With more time, I would love to implement the fuctionality more, enable the search bar to search the data, as well as the filter button to filter the receipts by date. 

Inentions: 
The SEE DETAILS button would pull up a page with just the single receipt selected. A bigger few, likely with more details than in quick view. 

I imagine an alternate page where receipts are displayed within a given time frame depending on wether the user has selected to sort by week, month or year. An arrow allowing them to move to the next time interval(ex/ the next week or month). I may continue to work on this to see how it develops. I like the search bar at the top, as I imagine it would be used frequently. 

The FILTER button would be a drop down menu, with the options week month year and a date input field for the user to search for a receipt from a specific date. 


Refelction:
Lost track of time focusing on outputting data from database and didnt get around to implementing functionality. I really enjoyed working on this project, and am pleased with how it looks aesethetically.
